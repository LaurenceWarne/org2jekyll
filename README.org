Blogging with org-mode and jekyll without strange yaml headers.

* Description

Let org2jekyll exports your org-mode file to jekyll to be happy.

* Pre-requisite

You have your org-publish ready.

Here is mine as example:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(custom-set-variables '(org-publish-project-alist
                        `(("tony-blog"
                           :base-directory ,(org2jekyll/input-directory)
                           :base-extension "org"
                           :publishing-directory ,(org2jekyll/output-directory "_posts")
                           :publishing-function org-html-publish-to-html
                           :headline-levels 4
                           :section-numbers nil
                           :with-toc nil
                           :html-head "<link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"./css/style.css\" type=\"text/css\"/>"
                           :html-preamble t
                           :recursive t
                           :make-index t
                           :html-extension "html"
                           :body-only t)

                          ("images"
                           :base-directory ,(org2jekyll/input-directory "img")
                           :base-extension "jpg\\|gif\\|png"
                           :publishing-directory ,(org2jekyll/output-directory "img")
                           :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

                          ("js"
                           :base-directory ,(org2jekyll/input-directory "js")
                           :base-extension "js"
                           :publishing-directory ,(org2jekyll/output-directory "js")
                           :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

                          ("other"
                           :base-directory ,(org2jekyll/input-directory "css")
                           :base-extension "css\\|el"
                           :publishing-directory ,(org2jekyll/output-directory "css")
                           :publishing-function org-publish-attachment)

                          ("website" :components ("org" "tony-blog" "images" "js" "css")))))
#+end_src

`tony-blog` is an important entry here

* Rationale

- standard org-mode rocks
- github uses jekyll
- jekyll is nice
- existing solutions regarding org-mode and jekyll needs the org-mode files to be altered to work together
- I don't want to alter my org-mode files with alien yaml headers to satisfy jekyll

Enters org2jekyll.

* How

Add some org headers:

#+begin_src org
#+BLOG: tony-blog
#+DATE: 2012-12-22
#+TITLE: About me
#+AUTHOR: Antoine R. Dumont
#+CATEGORIES: category0, category1
#+DESCRIPTION: Some description that makes sense for your article
#+end_src

*Note* BLOG entry refers to the `tony-blog` entry in `org-publish-project-alist`

Now publish it <kbd>M-x org2jekyll/publish-post!</kbd>
