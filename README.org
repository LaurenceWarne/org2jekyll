* Upgrade

** 0.2.0 -> 0.2.1

- The `tags:nil` option is now respected, aligning with org-mode. So, when nil,
  those are not exported in yaml headers.
- When generating new org2jekyll buffer, the default option is now `tags:t`
- `#+TAGS` and `#+CATEGORIES` are no longer comma separated values but space
  separated values. This is also to be in check with org-mode.

** 0.1.8 -> 0.1.9
- Remove deprecated api function names mentioned in 0.1.2 -> 0.1.4 migration.
- Allow user to define on per-buffer setup or per-custom variable basis some
  extra yaml header

** 0.1.2 -> 0.1.4

The [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Coding-Conventions.html][elisp coding convention]] was not respected up to this version. So between
the 0.1.2 and 0.1.3 version, the names and variables were updated to respect
them. Now every command and variables uses `org2jekyll-` and no longer
`org2jekyll/` prefix.

* Description

Let *org2jekyll* export your org-mode file to jekyll.

What's the difference with [[https://github.com/juanre/org-jekyll][org-jekyll]]?

You don't need to add some alien yaml in your org-mode file.
You add specific org-mode headers and this will be used to format the jekyll post.

What's the difference with [[https://github.com/bmaland/happyblogger][happyblogger]]?

Only emacs' dependencies (org, etc...) no external ruby script.

** Rationale

- [[http://orgmode.org/][org-mode]] rocks
- Github uses [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]]
- [[http://jekyllrb.com/][Jekyll]] is nice
- Existing solutions regarding org-mode and jekyll need the org-mode files to
  be altered with non-org notations to work together
- I don't want to alter my org-mode files with alien yaml headers to satisfy
  jekyll

Enters org2jekyll.

** Pre-requisite

You have:
- your [[http://orgmode.org/worg/org-tutorials/org-publish-html-tutorial.html][*org-publish*]] setup ready ([[https://github.com/ardumont/blog-pack/blob/master/blog-pack.el#L13-L71][mine for example]])
- a running [[http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll][jekyll]] installation

* Install/Setup

** Install

Available on [[http://melpa.org/#/getting-started][melpa]].

Update your packages archives:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'package)
(add-to-list 'package-archives '("melpa-stable" . "https://stable.melpa.org/packages/") t)
(package-initialize)
#+end_src

/M-x package-install RET org2jekyll RET/

** Setup

/M-x customize-group RET org2jekyll RET/

Here is an example of my configuration for my [[http://ardumont.github.io/][blog site]]:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(require 'org)
(require 'org2jekyll)

The previous sample contains important information:
- *default* and *post* represent the possible jekyll layouts you can use in your org2jekyll buffer `#+LAYOUT: default|post` (do not name those differently)
- *images*, *js*, *css* represent where you choose to store those kinds of files (you can name these as you wish)
- *web* is a composition of web files you may need to create a full post or page, typically, css, images, html, js, etc... (do not name this one differently either)

** A running example

- blog: [[http://ardumont.github.io/]]

- jekyll exported source: https://github.com/ardumont/ardumont.github.io

- the org files: https://github.com/ardumont/org.git

*Note* Yes, I may have to merge the last 2 repositories at some point...

** A reproducible example

You can clone this repository. Then, try and follow this [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/blob/master/testing-blog/org/blogging-with-org2jekyll.org][local article]].

* Use

For a post (layout 'post') or page (layout 'default'), add org headers (layout, title, author, date, description, categories) to your org files.

** Post

*** Headers

For a post (layout 'post'):
#+begin_src org
#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: hidestars
#+OPTIONS: H:2 num:nil tags:nil toc:nil timestamps:t
#+LAYOUT: post
#+AUTHOR: ardumont
#+DATE: 2014-12-19 Fri 23:49
#+TITLE: hello
#+DESCRIPTION: some description
#+CATEGORIES: category0, category1
#+end_src

*Note* To easily do that, /M-x org2jekyll-create-draft/, this will ask you for
everything needed and create a file with such metadata.

*** Publish

Now write your article in org-mode.

When ready, /M-x org2jekyll-publish/ to publish it.

This will be published as post article.

*** How

- The *#+LAYOUT* entry refers to the *post* entry in
  *org-publish-project-alist*.

- This will create another temporary org-mode file based on the current one
  with the right naming convention, transform the org headers into yaml,
  publish to the jekyll directory (according to your org-publish setup) and
  delete the temporary file.

*** Extra headers

As in [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/issues/36][issue 36]], you could [[http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/#predefined-global-variables][need to add some extra jekyll headers]].

Simply add them as org properties (thanks [[https://github.com/halcyon][@halcyon]] for his work on [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/pull/41][#41]]).

For example, adding those properties in the org file:
#+BEGIN_SRC org
#+THEME: blah
#+PLUGIN: lightense
#+SCHEME-HOVER: "#ff00b4"
#+END_SRC

Then publishing, will generate:
#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
---
...
theme: blah
plugin: lightense
scheme-hover: "#ff00b4"
---
#+END_SRC

** Page

*** Headers

For a page (layout 'default').

#+begin_src org
#+STARTUP: showall
#+STARTUP: hidestars
#+OPTIONS: H:2 num:nil tags:nil toc:nil timestamps:t
#+LAYOUT: default
#+AUTHOR: ardumont
#+DATE: 2014-12-19 Fri 23:49
#+TITLE: hello
#+DESCRIPTION: some description
#+CATEGORIES: some-category
#+end_src

*Note* To easily do that, /M-x org2jekyll-create-draft/, this will ask you for
everything needed and create a file with such metadata.

Now create your article and publish it when ready /M-x org2jekyll-publish/.

*** Publish

Write your page.
When ready, /M-x org2jekyll-publish/ to publish it.

*** How

- The *#+LAYOUT* entry refers to the *default* entry in
  *org-publish-project-alist*.
- This will update the current org-mode with the necessary yaml and publish to
  the jekyll directory (according to your org-publish setup), then revert back
  to your normal org-mode file.

*** Extra-headers

cf. [[#extra-headers][post extra-headers]]

** Publish all posts

/M-x org2jekyll-publish-posts/

Depending on your org-publish configuration and org2jekyll, this will compile
the list of org-mode posts (*#+LAYOUT* with 'post' value) and publish them.

** Publish all pages

/M-x org2jekyll-publish-pages/

Depending on your org-publish configuration and org2jekyll, this will compile
the list of org-mode pages (*#+LAYOUT* with 'default value) and publish them.

** Previews

You can keep an org file in your blog directory without publishing it, by
writing it as a plain org file without the org2jekyll headers. Once you're
ready to publish it as a post or an article, add the appropriate metadata
headers and org2jekyll will now publish the file.

* Minor mode

org2jekyll provides you a minor mode with the following default binding:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
(setq org2jekyll-mode-map
      (let ((map (make-sparse-keymap)))
        (define-key map (kbd "C-c . n") 'org2jekyll-create-draft)
        (define-key map (kbd "C-c . p") 'org2jekyll-publish-post)
        (define-key map (kbd "C-c . P") 'org2jekyll-publish-posts)
        (define-key map (kbd "C-c . l") 'org2jekyll-list-posts)
        (define-key map (kbd "C-c . d") 'org2jekyll-list-drafts)
        map))
#+end_src

*Note* [[https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/elisp/Key-Binding-Conventions.html#Key-Binding-Conventions][Respecting the default minor mode convention for binding]]

To (de)activate this in an org file: /M-x org2jekyll-mode/

As usual, you can use emacs' power to setup your own bindings.

* Layout customization

By default org2jekyll uses the layouts "post" (for article blog post) and
"default" (for mostly dynamic pages, e.g. contact, about, ...). This now can be
customized:

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
(custom-set-variables
 '(org2jekyll-jekyll-layout-page  "page")
 '(org2jekyll-jekyll-layout-post  "post")
 '(org2jekyll-jekyll-layouts     '("page" "post")))
#+END_SRC

It's up to the users to make sure the entries are correctly setup-ed in the
`org-publish-project-alist`.

See for example [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/blob/master/testing-blog/testing-blog-config.el][this sample configuration]] which define their own while keeping
correctly the `org-publish-project-alist` in sync.

* Problems

** dependencies

As a note, org2jekyll [[https://github.com/ardumont/org2jekyll/blob/master/org2jekyll.el#L8][declares its dependencies]] but it's possible that
some are not fully respected. And then problem [[#43][may arise]].  So if you
found out a problem about it, feel free to open an issue mentioning
the version of the library you are using.
